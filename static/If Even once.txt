If Even once

I would get the plates
And set the table
Open doors
and build the fable

If Even once

I would build her home
And share the bed
And Watch the clocks
and listen stead

If Even once

I would hold her heart
And kiss my love
to feel her breath
And only start

If Even once

I would build the roads
To see them come
Watch each one see
Her last of one

If Even once

I would tend the ground
And hand a cake
And offer things
That I could make

If Even once

I would learn it all
And share one light
A single hope
To warm her night

If Even once

I would love a life
To see her smile
Amidst the darkest
And horrid vile

If even once

was all it was
And all it meant was whisped away
I would know that life with her
Of just one day
Meant everything in every way
