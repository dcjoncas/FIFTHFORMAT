Drift Water

Cold nights breath past but the seasons stay
She waits and waits each passing day
But the stories over

Chorus

Black water swimming
She Falls back in time
waves of curves and salted skin
in her drift water mind


The stores over but she can’t see
The living lost and broken free
She’s a queen of hearts with blood soaked hands
Her choices burned behind her curtain stand

Chorus

Black water swimming
She Falls back in time
Curves of waves and salted skin
in her drift water mind

Looks away from lights of white
Cast alone in her darkest night
She looks away
She looks away
She falls

Chorus

Black water swimming
She Falls back in time
Waves of curves and salted skin
in her drift water mind

She’s falling now like the snow above she’s falling from he knight of love
Lightly dancing on the coldest ground
She finds herself never found

Chorus

Black water swimming
She Falls back in time
Curves of waves and salted skin
in her drift water mind

Her heart won’t end with a final swim
Bathed in silence and masked in sin
Choices made and cuts unhealed
And All that left each passing day is her

Black water swimming
She Falls back in time
Curves of waves and salted skin
in her drift water mind
