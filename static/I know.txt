I know I know I know

I know I’m not what you thought
My stomach in knotts
I know what it’s like to be me
That version of me

I know I know I know

I know I’m not what you dreamed
A shadow it seemed
I know what it’s like to be me
This version you see

I know I know I know

When your heart skips a beat
When your voice shakes inside
I know I know I know
All you give and all I hide

I know

I know I’m not what you see
This version of me
Handing shaking and cold
Getting worse getting old

I know I know I know


I know I’m not healthy you see
The cuts I make
Taking so much more then making
You know I see

I know I know I know
I know what you do for me
The fearless voice you fight
Attacks you more each night

Bridge

I’m not a dream or a life that easy you see
I know what it takes to be with me
You are my one and only though
The one I only know

I just wanted to say
That I know I know I know
