raging world 
raging home
raging world my home

tell the lies
on this backwards ride 
break the ties
where demons hide

slow the mind
bring that raging feel
filled with hate
no words are real
tell the lies
on this backwards ride 
break the ties
where demons hide

raging inside
mind isn't right
raging raging raging inside
this time, this fight

tell the lies
on this backwards ride 
break the ties
where demons hide

raging world passive guides
dead and fed from all the lies
raging vines strangle all
raging vines grow so tall

tell the lies
on this backwards ride 
break the ties
where demons hide

raging end never comes
feeds on pain, unknown ones
raging end, never asks
eats the dead lowered masks
rage and rage and rage along 
rage against this road alone
