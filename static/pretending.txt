She said it’s a sign
that it’s all for all time
She said I love you
And I said I do too

But That was last year or maybe a few

And it seems I’m ok
That’s it’s fadin today
It’s seems I’m ok
Pretending away

What’s happening
What’s happening here
Why is this what it is

Well maybe I’m just saying
What did I do
Why can’t I fix this with you
Why are you walking away

Well

And it seems I’m ok
That’s it’s fadin today
It’s seems I’m ok
Pretending away



She said I like you but I just don’t know
She said I want you but I have to go

she said I’ll see you later
I’ll love you later
I thought well that’s a sign
But I’m ok I’m so ok just
it seems I’m well
That’s it’s fadin today
It’s seems I’m well honestly I’m
Pretending away

Now I’m back at school and….My friends are cool … well mostly cool
I see you there along the wall
But your like a yesterday

So I guess I’ll walk by

And it seems I’m ok
That’s it’s faded away
It’s seems I’m ok
Pretending away
