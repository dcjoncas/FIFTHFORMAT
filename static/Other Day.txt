The Other Day
By the way I love you

I forgot to say
Your smile made me smile the other day

Just wanted you to know
I can’t stop thinking you know

About you and I don’t know
Just about you and what I know
I love you

I missed you today
Just wanted you to know
It’s not ok

I forgot to say
I love you

I forgot to say Your smile made me smile I forgot to say the other day
That I love you
The other day
