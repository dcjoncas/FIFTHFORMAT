These Days

What do you need me for
if you go and shut another door
What do you want to do
if I’m not any good for you

Stay in grace
Longs days await
Long days of hate

Stay in grace
Don’t look away
Long days

Stay in grace
Trust the pace
Long days

Stay in grace
Give in to the way
Long days

What do you want for me
What are these open doors
What do you want me to do
So I can be good for you

Pray in grace
I won’t look away
These days


Lay in grace
I will touch you softly
These days

Pray in grace
I will talk with you
These days

What are the doors behind your walls
I’m gonna break through and show you
What I can be
Cause you want this for me

Stay in grace
Gonna stay in grace
Gonna pray in grace
Gonna live in grace
These days
