Almost Real

The sun was brighter then
It seemed so much bigger
We bought a kite and saw it fly
We watched the party high

We could see the time to have
The clouds looked happy by
Remind me of us laughing die
Not a question or a wonder sigh


Chorus

My heart would beat
I thought we would be
The kind of love that didn’t steal
it was just
Almost real

The street light walks
As the dim night talks
We held our hands so tight
It was a movie night

I was so sure it was true
I could feel the ground
And it proved more than I knew
I felt your hand slip and thought
It was just a miss
It was just a miss

Chorus

My heart would beat
I thought we would be
The kind of love that didn’t steal
it was just
Almost real


I watched you walk ahead
But in my mind it was just a step
I tried to catch your look
It went through me
It went through me
I couldn't see that…
It was almost real

Chorus

My heart would beat
But it wasn’t what I thought
The kind of love that would always feel the kind of love that would always heal
The kind of love
but it was just
Almost real
