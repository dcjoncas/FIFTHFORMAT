It’s not nothing at all
How much I miss you
I don’t know what it is
Just one more day

Chorus

One more
I never thought ok ok
I never thought I never thought
Id only get
one more day

I always planned so far ahead and
Had it all worked out my head
A dance or two for us
But I wished I missed instead

Chorus

One more ok ok
I never thought ok ok
I never thought I never thought
Wed only get one
Just one more day

I heard there was a reason and I talked it out inside
I kept it close and wondered if this was true and tried
And I tried for just one day

Chorus

One more ok ok
I never thought ok ok
I never thought I never thought
Wed only get just one more day

So easy thinking back
To those silent falling tears
Waking up each morning
To the ringing in my ears
to all the faded memories and all those missing years
I thought we’d get just one more day

Chorus

One more ok ok
I never thought ok ok
I never thought I never thought
Wed only get just one more day


I never thought to ever say
Would you ever run that way
It’s never gonna be
It’s never gonna never gonna never
Just one more day



Bridge

It’s ok ok
Don’t worry please ok
I tell myself
But all I ever wish
Just One wish
Just one
