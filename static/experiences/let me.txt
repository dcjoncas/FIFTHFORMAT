He said you’re leaving today moving far away
and it’s just too hard to say
there’s so much he knows
about the feelings you show
that are only a moment away.
I see how he cares
by those little stares
and I know he’d want to say

Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red
don’t talk when it’s done and said
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself
and don’t cry alone in bed

Every night we danced by the fire light
Watched the boys grow and learn to fight.
It was fun and slow as country goes
but for you
it wasn’t right

Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red
don’t talk when it’s done and said
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself
and don’t cry alone in bed

Growing up was just a thing looking for love or a golden ring,
no one thought to search for something more
only you the girl next-door

Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red
don’t talk when it’s done and said
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself
and don’t cry alone in bed

We thought it was so true
but after all you always knew
now we know you’re on your way.
Feel the truth God speed I pray


Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red
don’t talk when it’s done and said
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself
and don’t cry alone in bed

Il be there when you need me
ill be there for you
you're gonna be ok now
I always knew
you are ready now,
but one last time please let me say



Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red
don’t talk when it’s done and said
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself
and don’t cry alone in bed
