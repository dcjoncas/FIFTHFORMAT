Shut up persevere
Don’t care don’t hear
This like last is not your year
You’re a useless fucking tear

What the fuck can I do
This is all I do I don’t play
I don’t even fucking prey, I’m not me I’m prey, a deer, shaking violently

You think you know me you think you see how I should be but it’s a mystery why you think you know me and my history when I’m the one from misery

I built this home
You watched alone not in the zone
Criticize me
Always resizing me
Look by me
As if I didn’t know
But I knew
I knew you and what you do



What the fuck can I do
This is all I do I don’t play
I don’t even fucking prey, I’m not me I’m prey, a deer, shaking violently

On the road everyday making pay
Then give it away
So we could stay but hey you say
Why I don’t give a shit about this pit that you sit
You should quit and get lesser pay so you could go away

What the fuck can I do
This is all I do I don’t play
I don’t even fucking prey, I’m not me I’m prey, a deer, shaking violently

Never be good enough for you
Nothing will ever be right for you
I’m just a fucking loser who
Brings nothing and takes too

I’m done with this self pity shit
Stay and quite just a bit
What the fuck is that weak ass oven mitt
I can’t even bake and I’m a human shake barely awake not watching the quake of what a fake cake I make


What the fuck can I do
This is all I do I don’t play
I don’t even fucking prey, I’m not me I’m prey, a deer, shaking violently


that’s who I am now
I’m not a man I’m a clown with an upside frown fucking sad clown with a sad frown from a sad town

Toxic you say but it’s at me this poison pop a pill Trey. So it’s at me but what the fuck is this word riddle way that I can’t play



I am a good man I am good one. Did what I was told too and kept up till I grew old too. Now I’m told I’m too old too to change what I know too so I guess it’s over cause I’m not new
Fuck that
It ain’t up to you
