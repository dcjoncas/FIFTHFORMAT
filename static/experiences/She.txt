She

Verse 1

Everyday we break some more
Forced to fight and settle score
Sleep at night and lock the door
Exposed again bleed the core

Chorus
She doesn’t know
What I know
She doesn’t go what I go
She fucking with me though
She with me


Verse 2
Pumped with gas and shoulders back
Ready waiting prep attack
This fucking thrill that not a pill
A fake life protecting drill


Chorus
She doesn’t know
What I know
She doesn’t go what I go
She with me though
She with me yo


Verse 3
You see what I see I know you do
We are the same me and you,pretending two. You see I know who you are cause we drive the same car so I must be right
To call your height

Chorus
She doesn’t know
What I know
She doesn’t go what I go
She fucking with me though
She with me

Verse4
I bought this vile that made me vile. I drank it down and I knew the sound this crown would make when I hit the ground.

She doesn’t know
What I know
She doesn’t go what I go
She with me though
She with me

Verse 5
What would you do if you could too
Choose something else that matched your you.
Would you , no money, no style, walk a mile after mile, fake smile real trial


Chorus
She doesn’t know
What I know
She doesn’t go what I go
She with me though
She with me yo

Verse 6
You ain’t the same but you ain’t different too
One pant leg on one shoe two
But your brand is real made real by you. I can only dream to ware it through.

Verse 7
Old streets each night being thoughtful being right but I see for me and laugh it down
This fucking tumor that grows inside my soul. I can’t even fix it if which ever way I roll but


Bridge
She knows
I don’t know
She knows what I go
the fucking road though
She with me
She knows
She’s me
