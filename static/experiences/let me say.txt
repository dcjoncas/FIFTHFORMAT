I see how he cares by those little stares and I know he’d want to say 

Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red 
don’t talk when it’s done and said 
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself 
and don’t cry alone in bed 

Every night we sat by the country fire light watch the boys get drunk and learn to fight. it was fun and slow as country goes but for you, it wasn’t right 

 Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red 
don’t talk when it’s done and said 
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself 
and don’t cry alone in bed 

Growing up was just a thing looking for lover golden ring, 
no one thought to search for something more 
only you the girl next-door  

 Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red 
don’t talk when it’s done and said 
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself 
and don’t cry alone in bed 

We thought it was so true but after all you always knew 
but now we know you’re on your way. 
Feel the truth Godspeed I pray 


 Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red 
don’t talk when it’s done and said 
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself 
and don’t cry alone in bed

 Chorus
don’t walk when the light is red 
don’t talk when it’s done and said 
don’t lose yourself to prove yourself 
and don’t cry alone in bed
